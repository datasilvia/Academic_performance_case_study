# Machine Learning Project: Predicting School Performance

![Kanban Board](trello.png)

## Project Description 📘
This Machine Learning project focuses on predicting school performance based on various factors. Throughout this week, we have applied and expanded our knowledge in artificial intelligence and machine learning, exploring concepts such as supervised learning, feature engineering, and more.

## Kanban Board for Task Management 🗂️
To efficiently manage our project, we organized our tasks using a Kanban board. This approach helped us stay organized, set deadlines, and divide the workload effectively. We divided our tasks into several sections:

### To Do 📝
Tasks that need to be started. This includes selecting the project topic, acquiring relevant data, and preparing the data for analysis.

### In Progress 🔄
Tasks that are currently being worked on. This includes cleaning and preparing the data, developing the initial Machine Learning model, and performing hyperparameter tuning.

### Watch 👀
Tasks that require monitoring or periodic review. This includes reviewing the quality of the acquired data, monitoring the model's performance on test data, and ensuring the code follows best practices.

### Done ✅
Tasks that have been completed. This includes selecting the project topic, acquiring relevant data, and preparing the presentation slides.

### Later ⏳
Tasks that are planned for future work. This includes implementing the model in a production environment, conducting additional tests with new data, and exploring unsupervised learning techniques.

## Communication 📞
We used Slack for communication between group members. This allowed us to stay in constant contact, share updates, and quickly resolve any issues that arose.

By organizing our tasks in this way, we were able to maintain a clear overview of our progress and ensure that all team members were aligned and working efficiently.
